# Foundations of Learning and Inference (FLI)

# 1. Introduction  
In this repo, I keep track of the pointers to several important resources and notions for modern learning theory. This is expected to be useful for self-taught learners who are bulding a mathametical background for machine learning research. The ultimate goal is to derive new efficient principled ML algorithms with theoretical guarantees for problems arising from *modern* *practical* settings. 

# 2. Background  

* Concentration inequalities   
  * VC shatter coefficient and VC dimension  
  * Classic concentration inequalities 
  * [Martingales](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/wp/concen.pdf)


* Rate of convergence   
  * Uniform convergence bounds  
  * Minimax rate of convergence 
  
* Optimization   
   * Frenchet duality
   * The interchangeability principle 
   * Convex optimization  
   * Convex-concave optimization  
   * Min-max problem by taking a function class to be a unit ball of RKHS 
   * Linear programming and convex duality  (e.g., an example of application, this [talk](http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/files/NPB20_s.pdf)). Convex duality is often used to reformulate an objective so that it can be represented via empirical samples.

   * Reinforcement Learning via Fenchel-Rockafellar Duality

* Statistics   
  * [Variance reduction](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~owen/mc/)  
    * Antithetic sampling: leverage the symmetry of the density to get more error cancellation.  
    * Stratification: Split the domain of the random variable into separate regions, and take samples from each region to estimate a target quantity.  
    * Coupling (or common random numbers): One common random variable Z that generates two other random variables X and Y, so when estimate the quantity f(X,Y), it is better to generate Z first to use for both X(Z) and Y(Z).   
    * Conditioning: E[f(X,Y)] = E[h(X)] where h(X) = E[f(X,Y) | X]. 
    * [Rao-Maxwellization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao%E2%80%93Blackwell_theorem)  
    * Control variates (and control variates by regression): Let's say we want to estimate E[f(X)]. If we have h ~ f and E[h(X)] is known, then h(X) is a control variate. We can construct a new estimator based on any crude estimator of E[f(X)] and the control variate. This results in a smaller variance.  
    * Moment matching and reweghting: Suppose we want to estimate E[f(X)] and we know E[X], we can use h(X) = X as control variate.  Reweighting is control variate via regression in moment matching case. 

  * Statistical bounds  
    * Cramer-Rao lower bounds: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound), [PhD thesis](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/10290/Moore_umd_0117E_11120.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
    * Minimax lower bounds 
  * [Delta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_method)

* Probability theory  
  * [Central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)  
  * [Order of approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_in_probability_notation)

* Applications 
  * Off-policy evaluation   
    * [DualDICE: Behavior-Agnostic Estimation of Discounted Stationary Distribution Corrections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04733): The square of an expectation in Eq. (6) is ugly and difficult to compute in practice, thus it is desirable to resolve this issue. Frenchet duality comes to the rescue by transforming such difficulty to the well-studied difficulty of convex-concave optimization. 

* General principles  
  * When a class of methods have strikingly common elements, it could be a good time to think about a unifying view of them.
